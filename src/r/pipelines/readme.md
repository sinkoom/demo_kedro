# Framebar Project
Hello! This is a project using the data science framework [*framebar*](https://github.com/EliLillyCo/framebar). `framebar` enforces good coding practices by structuring projects such that:
- Data dependencies and created data are clearly listed in a single location (the data catalog: catalog.yml);
- Function parameters are clearly listed in a single location (the parameters catalog: parameters.yml);
- Source code is kept under a single folder (src);
- Code written under the framework is modular and entirely built using functions;
- Function calls are explicit on what are its inputs and what its the outputs (node);
- All functions are organized in pipelines;
- Projects are easy to replicate and all pipelines are listed in a single location (hooks.R);
- Cached execution of pipelines is possible.
## Installation
To install `framebar` you will need access to the repository "EliLillyCo/framebar" repository and execute the following line in R: `renv::install("EliLillyCo/framebar")`.
## Running
To run this project execute the following line in R: `framebar::run()`.
